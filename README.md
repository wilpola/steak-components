# steak-components

steak-components is a React.js component library that is built with TypeScript, to make sure that the components behave in a desired manner. The component library will be built over time, and individual components will be used within a University website project called Project Gate.

## Why use steak-components?
The main reason for why steak-components was created, is that the web is starting to have a uniform look, and it needs some new life. There are some existing component libraries out there like Material-ui, and Bootstrap, but this opens a window for a new competitor to come and sweep people off their feet. Another reason is that these components will be reused across other personal projects, and it is beneficial for me (@wilpola) to build them once, and reuse at least the functional side of these components.
